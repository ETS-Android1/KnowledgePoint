</p>

<h1>Principal Components</h1>

<p>
The application has been built using the standard Android application framework components:
Activity, Intent, and Service. The following activities in particular provide the basic user
experience:
</p>

<ul>

<li><i>Login.</i> A login screen, featuring fields for the submission of ID and
password. Login can either be over the network, or local. The user cannot proceed until authentication has
been accomplished. 
</li>

<li><i>Welcome Page.</i> This provides the title of the application, plus a number of
buttons with which the user selects content. This includes a Prefatory and Help information,
and also the ability to provide user-feedback via email. Most typically, the user will
use this page to access the princpal content of the application, which is provided as a
series of textual documents, as videos, and as a voice-activated query system.</li>

<li><i>List and Grid Views.</i> Standard Android objects, which provide content-listings
from which a user can select content; including documents, chapters, and individual videos.</li>

<li><i>Book Covers.</i> These identify individual documents, and provide features for
navigating to and from their contents.</li>

<li><i>Chapter Activities.</i> These present textual and static graphical information, and
comprise the bulk of information provided by the application.</li>

<li><i>Video Activity.</i> This allows the viewing of a series of videos, explaining the
UltraAPEX user-experience.</li>

<li><i>Voice Activity</i> This allows technical terms to be queried vocally, and provides
audible responses.</li>

</ul>

<p>
The presence of several additional components should be noted:
</p>

<ul>

<li><i>Data Initialization Activity.</i>Used to load data from the zip file that
is downloaded from the Android Play Store, in accompaniment to the application.</li>

<li><i>Data Not Found Activity.</i> Used to terminate the application with a notification,
if required data is not present.</li>

<li><i>Go Landscape</i> and <i>Go Portrait Activities</i> demonstrate, as a courtesy to
the user when the application is first run, the occasional need to reorient the device from
portrait to landscape mode, and back again.</li>

<li><i>Adapters.</i> Employed by List and Grid View objects, these inflate XML-defined
rows, so that each becomes visible and user-responsive. This
allows the selection of documents, chapters, or individual videos.</li>

<li><i>XMLParser.</i> Used to generate a document object from XML data, and retrieve information
from the object.</li>

<li><i>ImageLoader, FileCache, MemoryCache,</i> and <i>Utils</i>, which provide support for
accessing graphics.</li>

<li><i>Meta files</i>. Used for the establishment of global values that may be required by multiple activities
during the running of the application.</li>

</ul>

<h1>Access to Content</h1>

<p>
The application makes use of the following kinds of data:
</p>

<ul>

<li>Video files in mp4 format.</li>

<li>Html files.</li>

<li>Image files in png format, which are referenced by the html files.</li>

<li>Term-definition strings, maintained as XML-content, which are used in the production
of audible responses to user-queries.</li>

<li>Meta-data, provided as XML-files, whereby documents, chapters, and videos can be
located by the application.</li>

</ul>
